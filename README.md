# Predicting Song Genre Using Text Rhythm

This repository hosts the implementation of a research-based approach to predicting the musical genre of songs from their lyrics, as detailed in the publication by Triantafillu, A. A., Mateshko, M. A., Shevchenko, V. L., & Sinitsyn, І. P. (2021). The project focuses on incorporating novel features such as the rhythm of the text and its morpho-syntactic structure to enhance genre classification accuracy.

## Publication Abstract

The music industry requires precise tools for classifying song genres to optimize marketing and distribution strategies. Existing methods, however, lack sufficient accuracy because they do not fully utilize the theoretical aspects of song classification. This work enhances genre classification accuracy by developing software that analyzes not only the lyrics but also the rhythm and morpho-syntactic structure of the text. Using Bayesian Classifier and Logistic Regression, this research introduces new metrics that significantly improve prediction capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Rhythm Analysis**: Extracts and utilizes the rhythm of the lyrics to predict genre.
- **Morpho-Syntactic Analysis**: Considers the grammatical structure of the lyrics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements Bayesian Classifier and Logistic Regression for genre prediction.
- **New Metrics**: Introduces novel metrics that focus on text rhythm and parts of speech.
